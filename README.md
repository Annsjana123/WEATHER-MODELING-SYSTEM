# WEATHER-MODELING-SYSTEM
This program demonstrates simple weather (temperature) modeling using Python. It calculates temperature with a quadratic equation based on time and coefficients. The program uses three input methods: hard-coded values, keyboard input, and file input, showcasing functions, user input handling, and file handling in Google Colab.
