# 🌦️Weather Modeling Using Python
📌 Description
This project demonstrates a simple weather (temperature) modeling program using Python.
The temperature is calculated using a quadratic equation based on time and coefficients:
Temperature=a×time2+b×time+c
The program shows three different ways to provide input:
Hard-coded values
Keyboard input
File input

🛠️ Features
Uses a Python function for temperature calculation
Demonstrates user input handling
Demonstrates file handling
Compatible with Google Colab

📂 Files Used
weather_data.txt
Contains coefficients and time values used for file-based input.

🧮 Function Used
def temperature_modeling(a, b, c, time):
    return a * time**2 + b * time + c

▶️ How the Program Works
1️⃣ Hard-Coded Input
Coefficients (a, b, c) and time are predefined in the code
Temperature is calculated and displayed

2️⃣ Keyboard Input
User enters coefficients and time during execution
Temperature is calculated based on user input

3️⃣ File Input
Coefficients and time are read from weather_data.txt
Temperature is calculated using file data

✅ Advantages
📊 Simple and easy-to-understand temperature modeling
🧮 Uses a mathematical equation to simulate real-world behavior
🧩 Modular design using a reusable Python function
⌨️ Demonstrates multiple input methods (hard-coded, keyboard, file)
📂 Introduces basic file handling concepts
🎓 Ideal for beginners learning Python fundamentals
☁️ Works smoothly on Google Colab and local systems

🚀 Future Enhancements
🌡️ Extend the model to include other weather parameters (humidity, pressure, rainfall)
📈 Add graphical visualization using matplotlib
🗃️ Support CSV and Excel file formats
⏱️ Enable real-time or multi-time-step temperature prediction
🌍 Integrate real-world weather datasets or APIs
🧠 Apply machine learning models for more accurate predictions
🖥️ Build a simple GUI using Tkinter or a web interface using Flask
📱 Make the project mobile-friendly via web deployment
